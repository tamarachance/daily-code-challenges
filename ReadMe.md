# Daily-Code-Challenges

This repository contains a running log of all of the code challenges that I have done while learning to code. It covers mainly Javascript challenges completed during my coding bootcamp days, Advent of Code challenges which I usually do using Javascript, and now Advent of Salesforce challenges completed in Apex. 

Over time I hope to grow this out by translating these early lessons into other languages that I developed as well as adding new challenges.
